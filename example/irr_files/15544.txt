remarks:        ===========================
remarks:
remarks:        DATAWAYS is a multiprotocol internet service provider
remarks:        founded in 2000 by a team of IT professionals with many
remarks:        years of technical expertise and knowledge in the area
remarks:        of information technology and telecommunications.
remarks:        The company has offices in Athens and Thessaloniki.
remarks:
remarks:        We provide IPv4/IPv6 transit with at least two major
remarks:        carriers in every location. We are also member of Greek
remarks:        Internet Exchange (GR-IX) and maintain peering agreements
remarks:        with other Greek major networks and members of GR-IX.
remarks:
remarks:        We are ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified and maintain a
remarks:        security policy according to Greek/EU laws. We are also
remarks:        a RIPE member since 2000 and we operate as a LIR.
remarks:
remarks:        We use the RIPE database as the primary IRR database
remarks:        in which we register most of our objects.
remarks:
remarks:        The as-set which contains our own AS number and all our
remarks:        customers' AS numbers is AS-DATAWAYS. Please use this
remarks:        as-set if you do prefix filtering, unless otherwise noted.

remarks:        Our PeeringDB record is at http://as15544.peeringdb.com

remarks:        General Peering Policy Info
remarks:        ===========================
remarks:
remarks:        - We honor no-export and no-advertise well-known
remarks:        communities.
remarks:
remarks:        - We do *NOT* honor the MED BGP attribute. All routes
remarks:        received from our upstreams, customers or IX-peers on both
remarks:        primary/backup routers get a metric of 0. Please see below
remarks:        about our primary/backup scheme.
remarks:
remarks:        - bogon/martian prefixes are rejected on import.
remarks:
remarks:        - Prefixes containing a bogon/reserved/private AS number
remarks:        in their as-path are rejected.
remarks:
remarks:        - We reject the default-route prefix (0/0, ::/0) from all
remarks:        peers (upstreams/customers/IX-peers).
remarks:
remarks:        - Prefixes longer than /24 for IPv4 or /48 for IPv6
remarks:        are rejected.
remarks:
remarks:        - We use BOTH prefix access lists and as-path access lists
remarks:        for prefix filtering. Customers or IX-peers imported
remarks:        prefixes must be registered with a valid route/route6
remarks:        object in the RIPE database. The prefix must be originating
remarks:        from the customer's AS or, in case the peer is an IX-peer,
remarks:        the peer's AS and their adjacent AS if any.
remarks:
remarks:        All other advertisements are rejected.
remarks:
remarks:        Our filters are automatically updated every business-day
remarks:        morning. Contact noc@dataways.gr for an irregular update.

remarks:        Primary/Backup BGP Routers
remarks:        ==========================
remarks:        DATAWAYS prefers to connect with other autonomous systems
remarks:        using a cluster of bgp routers with at least two BGP
remarks:        sessions for redundancy. Each session originates from a
remarks:        different router. The first/primary session is maintained
remarks:        on our primary-designated router while any other secondary
remarks:        sessions use our backup(s) router(s).
remarks:
remarks:        Routes received from our peers on the primary router always
remarks:        get a higher local preference than the backup router.
remarks:
remarks:        Our customers can fine-tune our local-preference values
remarks:        using the appropriate community tags. See below.
remarks:
remarks:        Routes advertised to our peers have their metric set to 0
remarks:        on primary and 20 on backup. If the remote AS does not
remarks:        honor the MED attribute we follow the appropriate
remarks:        technique as instructed by the remote AS import policy.
remarks:
remarks:
remarks:        BGP Communities used by our Customers
remarks:        =====================================
remarks:        Our customers can use the following communities to
remarks:        influence our BGP routers:
remarks:
remarks:        as-path prepend:
remarks:        ----------------
remarks:        15544:5000 Prepend 5 times to all Upstreams
remarks:        15544:5900 Prepend 5 times to all GR-IX Peers
remarks:
remarks:        local-preference override:
remarks:        --------------------------
remarks:        15544:7090 Set local-preference of customer's prefix
remarks:        to very-low local-preference mode.
remarks:
remarks:        In normal operations the customer's announcements have
remarks:        a higher local-preference value than IX-peers and
remarks:        upstreams announcements.
remarks:
remarks:        The order is: [CUSTOMER] > [IX-PEERS] > [UPSTREAMS]
remarks:
remarks:        If you tag your advertisements with 15544:7090 then
remarks:        the order changes to:
remarks:
remarks:        [IX-PEERS] > [UPSTREAMS] > [CUSTOMER]
remarks:
remarks:        In this mode, prefixes received from IX-peers and/or
remarks:        from our upstreams are more preferred. A multi-homed
remarks:        customer can utilize this mode to use us a
remarks:        backup/last resort path.
remarks:
remarks:
remarks:        Export Prefix Policy for our Customers
remarks:        ======================================
remarks:        We advertise the following prefix-sets to our customers:
remarks:
remarks:        FIRT: advertise the entire global BGP routing table
remarks:
remarks:        GRIX: advertise only prefixes learned from our GR-IX peers.
remarks:
